    #  Interval matches times that can be expressed as:
    #  Epoch + (n * every) + offset
    #  where n is all integers â‰¥ 0.

    #  For example, an `every` of 1 hour with `offset` of zero would match
    #  every hour, on the hour. The same `every` but an `offset`
    #  of 19 minutes would match every `xx:19:00`. An `every` of 28 days with
    #  `offset` zero would match `2022-02-17T00:00:00Z` (among other times).
    #  The same `every` with `offset` of 3 days, 5 hours, and 23 minutes
    # would match `2022-02-20T05:23:00Z` instead.
